                Origami is the art of paper-folding. It is an important art, as Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them. Step by Step diagrams are probably the most popular and easiest to follow way to show how to fold things out of paper. Trying to find good Origami instructions on the Internet can be lot of work though. To help your search, we've put together the largest database of free origami diagram anywhere on the Internet.
